  abstract = "{Bipedal locomotion over compliant terrain is an important and largely underexplored problem in the robotics community. Although robot walking has been achieved on some non-rigid surfaces with existing control methodologies, there is a need for a systematic framework applicable to different bipeds that enables stable locomotion over various compliant terrains. In this work, a novel energy-based framework is proposed that allows the dynamic locomotion of bipeds across a wide range of compliant surfaces. The proposed framework utilizes an extended version of the 3D Dual Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (Dual-SLIP) model that supports compliant terrains, while a bioinspired controller is employed to regulate expected perturbations of extremely low ground-stiffness levels. An energy-based methodology is introduced for tuning the bioinspired controller to enable dynamic walking with robustness to a wide range of low ground-stiffness one-step perturbations. The proposed system and controller are shown to mimic the vertical Ground Reaction Force (GRF) responses observed in human walking over compliant terrains. Moreover, they succeed in handling repeated unilateral stiffness perturbations under specific conditions. This work can advance the field of biped locomotion by providing a biomimetic method for generating stable human-like walking trajectories for bipedal robots over various compliant surfaces. Furthermore, the concepts of the proposed framework could be incorporated into the design of controllers for lower-limb prostheses with adjustable stiffness to improve their robustness over compliant surfaces.}",
