                <span className="text-body m-3">
                    As a Senior Robotics and Controls Engineer, my responsibilities include:
                    <ul className="m-3">
                        <li>Developing robotics and controls software and algorithms for medical applications</li>
                        <li>Designing, implementing and testing robotic algorithms in a real-time and FDA-regulated environment.</li>
                        <li>Troubleshooting related issues from the development of robotic algorithms and features</li>

                <h3 className="fw-medium m-3">Goals and Objectives</h3>

                <span className="text-body m-3">
                    At J&J Medtech, I build on my expertise in modeling and analyzing complex cable-driven mechanisms using multidisciplinary approaches. My work involves understanding deviations between theoretical models and real-world systems, accounting for factors such as noise, friction losses, and mechanical tolerances. The role also provides practical experience with industry standards for the validation and verification of control strategies. Additionally, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to support the stable, large-scale deployment of new algorithms within the company's existing software framework.
