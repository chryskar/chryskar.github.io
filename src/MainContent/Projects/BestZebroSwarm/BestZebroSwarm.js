                    In 2018, I had the privilege to attend an educational course of the Board of European Students of Technology (BEST), held at the Delft University of Technology in Netherlands.
                    The course focused on the current research and engineering in swarm robotics, with lectures about the current research and engineering in swarm robotics, delivered by
                    <a href="https://ocw.tudelft.nl/teachers/c-j-m-verhoeven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{marginRight: '0px'}}> Professor C. J. M Verhoeven</a>.
                    Besides lectures, we also attended lab workshops on implementing swarm behavior with the Zebro robots (shown below), and visited robotic start-up companies at
                    <a href="https://robohouse.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{marginRight: '0px'}}> RoboValley</a>.

                    <br/>

                    As a final assignment, we tried to make the robots swarm. The Robotics Institute provided us with Zebro robots, and in the end, we managed to let the Zebros communicate, but not swarm.
                    Specifically, we managed to make the robots detect and autonomously navigate towards a designated leader robot, which was a significant achievement given the time constraints and the complexity of the task.
